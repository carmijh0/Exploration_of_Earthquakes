# Exploration-of-Earthquakes
An exploration of earthquakes data from 1900 to the present, scrapped from wikipedia using beautiful soup and mapped using geopandas. 

The largest takeaway for me on this project was learning about how to create interactive visualizaiton for a user mainly by using ipywidgets and the power of regex to clean data. 
1.  Data was originally scrapped from wikipedia using beautiful soup. 
2.  Regex was mainly used to tidy the data.
3.  We focused in on using Geopandas along with Ipywidgets to create interactive widgets to display earthquakes based on magnitued and by country. 
4.  Tectonic plates were added to help illustrate where earthquakes occur. 
5.  Additioanl widgets were created to explore the relationship between variables within the data.  
6.  Folium package was used to plot all records of earthquakes, diplaying the magnitude and deaths of each event.
